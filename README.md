# COVID-19
Automated Detection of COVID-19 Cases Using Deep Neural Networks with X-Ray Images

In this project, we have proposed DarkCovidNet for automated detection of COVID-19. 
We have added the X-ray image dataset used for the training and testing of the deep model and the ipython file of DarkCovidNet model to this repository.
